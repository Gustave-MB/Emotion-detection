# Emotion-detection
> This repository contains notebook `Facial_expression.ipynb` for training Squeeze-Excitation ResNet for emotion classification using FER2013 dataset.

> Another notebook `Convert_to_onnx` for converting the torch model into onnx.

> It also contains python script `connect_camera_onnx.py` for connecting to a  USB Camera or a Laptop Camera using OpenCV and predict based on the input frames
>> OpenCV can automatically connect to your laptop's built in camera or your USB camera if you've installed that specific USB camera drivers. If you are not able to connect, please check out the troubleshooting tips here: `https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/8471`
